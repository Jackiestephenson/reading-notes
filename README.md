# My Reading Journal

### My reading journal for Code Fellows

Growth mindset is knowing you can learn any skill or behavior if you put work into it. It is also realizing that humans aren't just born with skills or talents and we have to learn to grow and change.

>[!Important]
>Three reminders to stay in growth mindset.

1. Expect mistakes, and be forgiving to yourself.

2.  Be patient! Nobody learns everything they need in one day.

3.  Celebrate your success! **You didn't think you could do it and _you did_!**

I'm a mom who is excited to learn a new skill and hopefully jumpstart her career in the tech field.

## What is markdown? And why do we use it?

Markdown is one of the most popular lightweight markup languages; created by John Gruber in 2004. Markdown adds formatting elements to text documents. We use markdown because it is versatile, long lasting, and used almost everywhere. Markdown is also platform independent; making it more accessible and utilized more often.

If you want to use headings in markdown it's as simple as placing a certain number of #. For the largest heading you will use between one to six #'s. Here is an example: 

# This is the biggest heading!

###### This is the smallest heading!

Using italics in markdown is best done with asterisks. An example is **This is bold text** and this is *italicized* 

When making links in markdown you put the part you want to be clickable (the in line link) in brackets and the actual web address in parenthesis. An example is [this is a link](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/link)   it takes you to the definition of the word link. 

You can use asterisks, dashes, or plus signs to add an unordered bullet point list. Example:

* this is a list
+ in no particular order
- just a bullet point list

Text editors are a cruical tool and customizeable depending on the one you choose. They can have different lighting and text colors to help elleviate eye strain, and to make it easier to see errors. Computers have built in text editors (word pad, text edit, or ged it)
