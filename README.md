## What is markdown? And why do we use it?

Markdown is one of the most popular lightweight markup languages; created by John Gruber in 2004. Markdown adds formatting elements to text documents. We use markdown because it is versatile, long lasting, and used almost everywhere. Markdown is also platform independent; making it more accessible and utilized more often.

If you want to use headings in markdown it's as simple as placing a certain number of #. For the largest heading you will use between one to six #'s. Here is an example:

# This is the biggest heading

###### This is the smallest heading

Using italics in markdown is best done with asterisks. An example is **This is bold text** and this is *italicized*

When making links in markdown you put the part you want to be clickable (the in line link) in brackets and the actual web address in parenthesis. An example is [this is a link](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/link)   it takes you to the definition of the word link.

You can use asterisks, dashes, or plus signs to add an unordered bullet point list. Example:

* this is a list

* in no particular order

* just a bullet point list

# Reading 02 The Coder's Computer

Text editors are a cruical tool and customizeable depending on the one you choose. They can have different lighting and text colors to help elleviate eye strain, and to make it easier to see errors. Computers have built in text editors (word pad, text edit, or ged it)

It can be helpful to have multiple terminals open at once. ls short for list shows you where you are. pwd means Print Working Directory.

~ is a shortcut to your directory, . is in reference to current directory, .. is in reference to a parent directory. cd means change directory. File tells you what type of file it is. ls-a will show hidden files.

1. -code completion, syntax highlighting, a variety of themes, and lots of extensions available.

2.pwd- writes out full path name
  ls- lists files
  cd- changes directory
  mkdir- makes new directory
  touch- creates empty file

3. 1. change directory to projects
   2. make a new directory called new directory
  
   3. ;
   4. change directory to parent directory
   5. lists opening a new project.
