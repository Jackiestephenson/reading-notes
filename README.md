# My Reading Journal

### My reading journal for Code Fellows

Growth mindset is knowing you can learn any skill or behavior if you put work into it. It is also realizing that humans aren't just born with skills or talents and we have to learn to grow and change.

>[!Important]
>Three reminders to stay in growth mindset.

1. Expect mistakes, and be forgiving to yourself.

2.  Be patient! Nobody learns everything they need in one day.

3.  Celebrate your success! **You didn't think you could do it and _you did_!**

I'm a mom who is excited to learn a new skill and hopefully jumpstart her career in the tech field.
